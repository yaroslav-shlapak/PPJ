/*
Write a program which rotates a given array of ints by n position to the left, i.e.,
the first element should be replaced by (n + 1)-st, the second by (n + 2)-nd etc.,
and the first n elements should be placed at the end of the array.
For example, the array 1 2 3 4 5 after rotation to the left by three position should become 4 5 1 2 3
Solve this problem in three ways:
• applying, in a loop, n times the rotation to the left by one position (see previous tasks);
• creating one auxiliary array and copying elements of the arrays in loops;
• creating one auxiliary array and using the function System::arraycopy (without any explicit loops)
