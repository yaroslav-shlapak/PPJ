/*
Write a function

public static int[] sumOfTwo(int[] arr, int val)

taking an array arr containing sorted elements of type int and an integer val.
The function looks for two elements of the array which sum up to val.
The values of indices of these two elements are returned in a two-element array of ints.
If there are no such elements, both returned indices are set to −1.

You may use only one loop (without explicit or “hidden” nested loops).
In other words, the algorithm must be linear with respect to the size of the array.
Do not use any auxiliary collections or arrays.

For example, the fragment

int[] a = { 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15 };
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sumOfTwo(a, 21)));

should print [3, 6].
